/// [`ternary`]
///
/// A macro for ternary conditional operation([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_conditional_operator)) in rust.
///
/// This macro evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on whether the condition
/// is true or false.
///
/// # Examples:
///
///```rust
/// use macrors::ternary;
///
/// let x = 5;
/// let y = 10;
///
/// let result = ternary!(x < y, "x is less than y", "x is not less than y");
/// assert_eq!(result, "x is less than y");
/// ```
/// ```

/// [`ternary_eq`]
///
/// A macro for ternary conditional operation with equality comparison.

/// ```rust

///
/// let x = 5;
/// let y = 10;
///
/// let result_eq = ternary_eq!(x, y, "x is equal to y", "x is not equal to y");
